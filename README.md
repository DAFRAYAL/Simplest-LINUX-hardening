# Simplest LINUX hardening and benchmark

Will add other unix system groups allocations later. You can always use ITARIAN, SNORT services.

Don't use asterisk in DEBIAN packaging installations. You may try that on RED HAT.

ORACLE LINUX is most recommended. Yet CENTOS Is more compatible with packages.

UBUNTU is the best.

Use PCI-DSS, CIS or DISA policies if you want, but this is pretty much it. I think that you can use your user account as exclusive with automatic logon while having its chroot at zero.

If you cannot install UNIX through kind of VENTOY set of UEFI boot loading then do not install it at all since intranet.

Use encrypted containers or encrypted virtual hard drives instead of disk encryptions for any work since internet.
